The image features a male tennis player wearing only a wet suit splashing water onto a large, clear vase, likely trying to catch it. He is playing a game of volleyball and the ball is notably bigger and higher than normal tennis balls. The scene is captured on a beach location, with a railing in the background.

The image captures the energy and excitement of the sport with a sense of competitiveness and athleticism in the player's stance and swiping the ball.
